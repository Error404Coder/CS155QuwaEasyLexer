# QUIWA EASY Lexer

The program takes in a ".easy" file and converts and prints the strings inside into token classes at the terminal.

## How to run:

1. First make sure that the dependencies are installed (flex and gcc)
2. Type `flex main.lex`in your terminal and enter.
3. Type `gcc lex.yy.c -lfl` and enter.
4. Type `./a.out <file_name.easy>` replacing <file_name.easy> with the input file that you want to be converted to string.
5. The code will then run and print the token class into your terminal.
